## Prerequisites

This is an example application, simulating the real-world fetch behavior. The application is built using responsive design patterns and ideally should be accessible on any device with the Internet connection.

## Goals

The application helps the user to find a restaurant in the neighborhoods, shows its rating and other users' comments, which are loaded from an internal database. The HTML elements of the restaurant after selection are added dynamically using Vanilla JS.

## Instructions

User opens the application and sets the corresponding filters (town and food type). The filter results are displayed just after the filter set, displaying a list of restaurants with an image, name and address. The restaurant card contains the interactive button to view details. When this button is pressed, the application shows opening hours and reviews. The application also contains an interactive map, which shows the location of the restaurant.
